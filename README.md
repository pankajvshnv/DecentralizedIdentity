# Decentralized Identity System for Core Chain

## Project Title
Decentralized Identity System: A Self-Sovereign Identity Solution for Core Chain Users

## Project Description
A blockchain-based identity management solution built on Core Chain that enables users to create and control their digital identities without centralized authorities. The system stores identity references on-chain while keeping sensitive personal information off-chain for privacy and scalability.

## Project Vision
To revolutionize digital identity management by:
- Giving users complete ownership of their personal data
- Enabling verification without exposing sensitive information
- Creating a trustless identity layer for the Core Chain ecosystem
- Eliminating single points of failure for identity systems

## Key Features
- Self-sovereign identity creation and management
- Privacy-preserving design with off-chain data storage
- Immutable identity history with timestamp tracking
- Simple verification mechanism for dApps and users
- Gas-efficient implementation with just 3 core functions
